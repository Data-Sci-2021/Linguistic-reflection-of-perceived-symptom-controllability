This is the final project for Data Science for Linguists (LING 2340) in Fall 2021. The purpose is to explore the linguistic remarks of perceived symptom controllability for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. 
The population of the study is women with recurrent ovarian cancer. In general, the population suffer high symptom burden.  The five-year survival rate was 48.6% and around 85% will have recurrence. After initial recurrence, managing multiple symptoms become the new goals of cancer remission and stabilization. We need novel symptom management interventions to improve patientsâ€™ symptoms and quality of life. The WRITE Symptoms (written representational intervention to ease symptoms) study  is a three-arm randomized controlled trial improve symptom management and life quality for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. Findings from the self-directed arm of  WRITE Symptoms (SD WRITE) demonstrated variability in patient symptom controllability, which is associated with multiple factors. We want to explore the linguistic features suggesting patient high vs low sense of control over their symptoms to help clinician idenitfy and tailor intervention content for patients who are at risk for low sense of control. 

Data includes ID, answer to the symptom reprsentation question, symptom name, controbability score at 8 weeks and baseline, socio-demographic factors (i.e., age, marriage status, employment, education, race, ethnicity). 
The dependent variable symptom controllability was measured using Symptom representations questionnaire. 
3 items for each symptom addressing the extent to which the person believes that they can control the symptom on a 5- point Likert-type scale of 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).
